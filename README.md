# Turf Booking System - Full Stack Project

## Overview

The Turf Booking System is a full-stack web application that enables users to view and book sports turfs, and allows turf owners to advertise their turfs. The system includes a user interface for turf booking, an admin panel for managing bookings and turf advertisements, and communication between users and admins. The application is built using **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend with **MySQL** as the database.

## Features

- **Turf List Page**: Displays available turfs with filtering options based on various criteria (e.g., location, type of sport, availability).
- **Advertisement Page**: Turf owners can submit a form to advertise their turfs. Once submitted, a notification is sent to the admin for approval.
- **Login/Signup**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Contact Us Page**: Provides users with the ability to contact the system administrators.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can view the list of turfs, approve or reject turf advertisements, and perform CRUD operations on turfs.
