# Turf Booking System - Full Stack Project

## Overview

The Turf Booking System is a full-stack web application that enables users to view and book sports turfs, and allows turf owners to advertise their turfs. The system includes a user interface for turf booking, an admin panel for managing bookings and turf advertisements, and communication between users and admins. The application is built using **React** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend with **MySQL** as the database.
